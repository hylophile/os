My custom image based on [[https://fedoraproject.org/sericea/][Fedora Sericea]] with a few changes & my dotfiles configured on first-boot

* Intro
This image makes the following changes:

** Replace =toolbox= with =distrobox=
Over time, I've hit a number of issues with =toolbox= that seem to be either
=WONTFIX= or in a perpetual state of "someday"; so I instead opt for [[https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox][distrobox]].
Boasting a larger featureset and resolving every single issue I've had with
=toolbox=, it's simply a better product.

** Removing the =fedora= flatpak repo
I'll never want to install anything from here, it's super convenient for most
but because of things like missing codecs (see below)

** Remove the base =firefox= in favour of flatpak
Due to licensing issues, Fedora can't ship modern codecs. As such, it becomes a
hassle having to layer so many packages to get it working and I have instead
opted for the flathub flatpak version; which has everything I could need.

** Enabling automatic updates
Now that update issues get picked up in CI, I can safely just have everything
update all the time.

Likewise for flatpaks with the included =flatpak-automatic= service & timer

** Include the most recent version of =babashka=
I rely on this for a few things, there's no "proper" packaged version yet so I
just pull from the official image.

** Includes a number of tools intended to end up in =/usr/local/bin=
- [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]]

  on my changes for me, I encourage you to use theirs instead.
